# Typescript_learning
- TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It is pure object-oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed programming languages

## Why use Typescript
- Static typing:
  -- JavaScript is dynamically typed and does not know what type a variable is until it is actually instantiated at run-time. TypeScript adds type support to JavaScript.

- Type Inference:
  -- TypeScript makes typing a bit easier and a lot less explicit by the usage of type inference. Even if you donâ€™t explicitly type the types, they are still there to save you from doing something which otherwise would result in a run-time error.
  
## For react
- ```npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript```
- Browsers don't know how to run typescript code - we need compiler to transfer typescript code to javascript code. You see ```tsconfig.json``` in ```my-app``` folder which converts TS to regular JS.
